# Message from Dev

This is a personal portfolio website built using React, a popular front-end JavaScript library. It features several pages including a home page, an about page, a projects page, and a contact page.

The home page provides an introduction to the website and features links to my social media profiles. The about page provides a brief biography, education, skills, and work experience. The projects page showcases several projects I have worked on, including a description, the programming languages used, and a link to the project's Github repository. Finally, the contact page features a simple form for users to contact me directly.

The website was built using several third-party libraries, including React Router for routing, EmailJS for sending email, and Font Awesome for displaying icons. The website also utilizes CSS animations and transitions to make it more visually appealing.

The development environment for this project includes Node.js, which is used to manage dependencies and run build scripts. The project is set up with Webpack as a module bundler and Babel as a transpiler to enable the use of modern JavaScript features. The website is deployed using Netlify, a cloud hosting platform.

Overall, this project showcases my technical skills and provides a glimpse into my work as a software developer.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
